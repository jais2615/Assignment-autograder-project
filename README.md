# Assignment Auto Grader Portal

A **Streamlit-based web portal** for seamless assignment submission and automatic evaluation. It provides dedicated interfaces for both students and evaluators (TAs), making the grading process efficient, secure, and insightful.

##  Features

### 1.  Authentication & File Upload  
- Students securely log in and upload multiple files per assignment.  
- Ensures confidentiality and streamlines the submission process.

### 2.  Late Submission Detection  
- Automatically checks submission time against assignment deadlines.  
- Flags late submissions for evaluators.

### 3.  Plagiarism Detection  
Evaluators can check for code similarity using a **custom-built plagiarism checker**.  
A match is flagged if similarity exceeds a defined threshold.

**How it works:**
-  **Porter Stemming** to normalize text  
-  **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
-  **Cosine Similarity** for comparison

### 4. Auto-Grading with Test Cases  
- Runs submitted code against provided test cases.  
- Compares outputs and shows pass/fail status.  
- Displays any syntax errors for quick debugging.

### 5.  Review & Feedback  
The system evaluates:
- 75 points for Test Case Accuracy  
- 25 points for Code Quality & Documentation

**C++ Code Quality Metrics:**
-  Comment-to-code ratio  
-  Expression complexity  
-  Indentation issues  
-  Repetition  
-  Variable naming & scoping

> Python files are analyzed using `pylint`; C++ analysis is custom-built.

### 6.  No External APIs  
- No third-party APIs used  
- All logic is written from scratch for **plagiarism** and **code analysis**

##  Future Updates

1. **Multi-language Support:** Add Java, JavaScript, etc.  
2. **Mobile App:** Android/iOS app for submission and grading.
